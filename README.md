# Streaming-Platform-Analysis
This is the final project for ECE 143 at UCSD
## Context
There are so many online streaming platforms that each offer their own collection of movies and TV Shows. With these increasing options, it can be difficult to evalute which ones to subscribe to. In this analysis, we evaluate the 4 most popular platforms: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney Plus. We present the best platform to subscribe depending on the type of content that you enjoy. We also present an easy-to-use tool that recommends movies and tv shows based on a content of your choice, or by filtering on your preferences. 

## Data
Our dataset comes from ShivamB on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) who regularly scrapes the 4 platforms for their content. Please re-download the data instead of using the ones in this repo to get the most up to date content
